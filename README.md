## 👋🏽 About me

I am Maxi Redigonda, I study Computer Science in 🇦🇷 Argentina.

During my highschool and early university years I was deeply involved in **programming competitions**, reaching the final instances of the [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) and the [IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/).

Later on, for my Software Engineering roles, I applied not only my data structures, algorithms, and problem solving skills, but also the team-working and rapid-learning abilities that those competitions help to grow.

## 👷🏽 Work Experience
